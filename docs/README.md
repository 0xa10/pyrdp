# The PyRDP library
Our RDP implementation was designed so it could be used for tools other than our MITM.

This section is still under construction. It will explain how to use the classes in PyRDP to achieve your goals.
In the meantime, we advise you to look at the following resources:

- Our documentation on [layers](layers.md).
- [The RDP connection sequence](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc240452.aspx).
- Our MITM implementation (`pyrdp.mitm.client` and `pyrdp.mitm.server`).
